      <h2>ME</h2>
      <div class="my-story">
        <h5>My Story</h5>
        <p>For several years I had been impacting people's lives through coaching. Influencing a person's development and experiences is very rewarding but I wanted to have an impact on a global scale.</p>
        <p>In addition to coaching, I worked on the company's website and quickly realized I wanted to have control on how things were displayed to the user - I was excited to discover the world of web development and code and began learning through online resources.</p>
        <p>More recently, I attended the Iron Yard Academy in Atlanta, GA - a full-time front end development program - to enhance my code base and ensure I stayed current with the latest technologies.</p>
        <p>I've always had a passion for technology and developing or enhancing web applications has enabled me to not only reach more people but to also continue to influence experiences.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="my-experiences">
        <h5>My Experiences</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Born and raised in England, football (or as American's would say...soccer) has been a big part of my life. Watching, playing, or coaching is something I have always enjoyed. Win, lose, or draw, I support Tottenham Hotspur FC</li>
          <li>I love to travel. My wife and I are currently on a journey to see the 7 modern wonders of the world. We have seen 6 of the 7 and plan to visit Jordan next year to see Petra! The next journey will be to step foot on all of the continents in world</li>

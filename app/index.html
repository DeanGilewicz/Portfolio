        <h5>Story</h5>
        <p>
          Over the past few years, I have been impacting people's lives through coaching. Influencing a person's development
          and experience is very rewarding but I wanted to have an impact on a global scale.

          I've always had a passion for technology so this was a natural path for me to pursue to not only have a larger impact
          on the world via web apps but to have an influence on a user's experience.

          In addition to coaching, I worked on the company's website and quickly realized I wanted to have control on how things
          were displayed for the user - I was excited to discover the world of web development and code and began learning
          through online resources. I then dove in two footed and attended the Iron Yard Academy in Atlanta, GA - a full-time
          front end development program - to enhance my code base and ensure I stayed current with the latest technologies.
        </p>
        <h5>Motivation</h5>
        <p>
          comes from...
            an ongoing drive to better myself and the experiences I can provide users

          attracted to environments where...
            people care what they do
            people take pride in their contribution and performance
            people work hard but enjoy life
            people enjoy the process of collaboration
        </p>
        <h5>Experiences</h5>
        <p>
          Born and raised in England, football (or as American's would say...soccer) has been a big part of my life. Watching,
          playing, or coaching is something I have always enjoyed. Win, lose, or draw, I support Tottenham Hotspur FC.

          I love to travel. My wife and I are currently on a journey to see the 7 modern wonders of the world.
          We have seen 6 of the 7 and plan to visit Jordan next year to see Petra! The next journey will be to step foot on all
          of the continents in world...

          My first ever hackathon where I was the only front end developer on the team collaborating with IOS and Rails developers.

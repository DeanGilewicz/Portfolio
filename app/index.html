        Two years ago I decided to make a change. I left a career in the non-profit field to pursue web design. Why? I am convinced I can make a wider impact on the world via web applications.

        Software design is about changing behavior, making things more efficient, and being a catalyst of decision. In my opinion, the harmony between design and development (and the people behind both) combine to create better solutions for the end user. I'm looking for a position on a design team as a front-end developer where I can be part of that process.

        Inspiration
        I'm inspired by people. People who love what they do. People who love the collaboration process & welcome feedback. People who work hard but enjoy life.

        Motivation
        I'm motivated by love for my family and their love for me. I'm motivated by an ongoing drive to better myself and the world around me. Hope is my jam.

        Thrivation
        I thrive when there is just enough guidance to support the creative process as it organically takes shape. I thrive on solving UX/UI problems. I thrive in places where I can learn from those around me.

        About Me
        I am a freelance developer having just completed a bootcamp style front-end program. I persistently ask 'why' to get the clearest picture of the project goal and how best to accomplish it. I have a simple and clean design aesthetic. I work best in collaboration and I enjoy taking abstract ideas and creating something concrete, efficient and beautiful.
